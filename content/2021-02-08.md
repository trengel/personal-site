# Automatic RSS

PHPetite ships with a very basic and crude auto-generated RSS feed. When you run the project's build script:

```.bash
bash build.sh
```

it not only generates the single HTML blog file, but also creates an `atom.xml` file in the root directory. Simply share this with your followers or link it somewhere on your site itself (eg. `yourdomain.com/atom.xml`).

You can view this site's RSS feed here:
