<p>Thanks for stopping by. I'm Tristan Engel, an aspiring IT professional, reluctant techie and hobbyist web developer. I'm currently looking for a job in IT support, but nevermind telling you what I do for workâ€”that's what <a href="//www.linkedin.com/in/trengel/">my LinkedIn profile</a> is for. My hope is that this site will suffice for any other social media presence. If you want to get to know me a little more, you can see what I'm doing right <a href="/now.html">now</a>.
<p>Come back later when I actually start blogging!
